Reports cases when non-safe string is passed to a method with parameter marked with <code>@Untainted</code> annotations, returned from annotated methods
or assigned to annotated fields, parameters or local variables.
<p>
  Safe object is:
<ul>
  <li>a string literal, interface instance or enum object</li>
  <li>a result of a call of a method that is marked as <code>@Untainted</code></li>
  <li>a private or final field, local variable or parameter that are marked as <code>@Untainted</code> and are  not assigned from non-safe objects</li>
  This field, local variable or parameter must not be passed as arguments to methods or used as a qualifier, or must be a primitive or its wrapper.
</ul>
<p>
The analysis is performed only inside the one file. To process dependencies from other classes, use options.
The analysis  extends to private or static methods, final fields and has limit of depth propagation.
Example:
<pre>
<code lang="java">
  void doSmth(boolean b) {
    String s = safe();
    String s1 = "other";
    if (b) s1 = s;
    sink(s);
  }
  
  String sink(@Untainted String s) {}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Here we do not have non-safe string assignments to <code>s</code> so warning is not produced. On the other hand:
<pre>
<code lang="java">
  void doSmth(boolean b) {
    String s = safe();
    String s1 = "other";
    s1 = foo();
    if (b) s = s1;
    sink(s);        // warning here
  }
  
  String foo();

  String sink(@Untainted String s) {}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Here we have a warning since <code>s1</code> has an unknown state after <code>foo</code> call result assignment.

    <p>Use the <b>Untainted annotations</b> table to specify annotations, which will be used as <code>@Untainted</code> annotations during the analysis.
      The first annotation from this list will be used for propagation if it exists in classpath.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Tainted annotations</b> table to specify annotations, which will be used as <code>@Tainted</code> annotations during the analysis
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the <b>Consider external methods untainted if receivers and arguments are untainted</b> option is enabled,
      then external methods outside the current class will be considered as safe if its receivers and arguments are safe.
      For some cases, it is not applicable, but it can be useful for stateless classes.
    If this option is disabled, then all external methods will be considered as unsafe.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <b>Safe classes</b> option to specify classes, expression with this type will be considered as safe
  </li>
